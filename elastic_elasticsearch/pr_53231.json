While queries TermsQuery or subclasses of AutomatonQuery ignore\nthis argument, FuzzyQuery uses it to create a FuzzyTermsEnum which triggers an\nNPE when the AttributeSource is not provided. This PR fixes this by supplying an\nempty AttributeSource instead of a `null` value.\n\nCloses #52894", "committedDate": "2020-03-06T15:55:20Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4OTE2MTk5Mg==", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/53231#discussion_r389161992", "body": "Can you change to a more descriptive name ?
