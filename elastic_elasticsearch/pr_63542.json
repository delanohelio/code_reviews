This may not always be the case though.\nIt's also true that in the future if two commands were processed out-of-order in the C++ then this Java code would delay one of the threads waiting for a response unnecessarily.  However, it wouldn't be a deadlock - it would just mean threads 1 and 2 would unblock on the response to command 1 (or disconnection of controller) even though thread 2 could have unblocked on the earlier response to command 2.\nSo some optimisation work could be done here if the C++ is ever modified to process commands out-of-order.\nThe actual parsing needs to synchronize on responseIteratorHolder, because only one thread can be parsing the stream at any time.  What could be done is that the other threads simply wait for their response latches on the assumption that the thread doing the parsing will count these down.  However, this is non-trivial, because if the thread doing the parsing has just decided that it can stop parsing but hasn't exited the synchronized block then no thread would be parsing.  So it would need more complex synchronization to ensure that the decision of one thread to wait for its latch instead of for the parser lock would need to be atomic with the thread currently holding the parser lock to decide to stop parsing (which is not the same as releasing the parser lock).  Rather than risk messing this up I went for the simpler approach.\nThe alternative is to have a dedicated thread for parsing responses like we do for most C++ outputs, but this seems wasteful in the case of controller where there is very low traffic and we'd be permanently hogging a thread for it.", "author": "droberts195", "createdAt": "2020-10-12T17:23:06Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUwMzI3ODU5MQ=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUwMzQ2NjMwMw==", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/63542#discussion_r503466303", "bodyText": "\ud83d\udc4d\nThanks for the additional information.
