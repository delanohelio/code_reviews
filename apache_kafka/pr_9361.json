The compiler will check the source code of the processor and enforce this at compile time. It sounds like this is one part of what you are thinking about.\nBut inside the ProcessorContextImpl, we're outside of the Processor, and in the \"plumbing\" of Streams. In this context, we cannot have compile-time type safety, since we can't bound all of KafkaStreams to accept only one kind of record and processor.\nHowever, what we can check at compile time is that we only attach compatible children to parents. This isn't a way to do this in Topology right now, and I didn't want to expand this KIP to that extent. My plan for getting the full benefit of this KIP in the DSL internals is to actually add an internal utility method for registering pairs of processors, like this:\n    void addGraphNode(final StreamsGraphNode<KIn, VIn, KIntermediate, VIntermediate> parent,\n                      final StreamsGraphNode<KIntermediate, VIntermediate, KOut, VOut> child);\nThen, in addition to a compile-time guarantee that a processor can only forward its declared output type, we also get a guarantee that the builder can only attach compatible parent-child pairs. Assuming you don't do any casting in \"user space\",\nwe don't need any further compiler checking to render cast exceptions impossible. The \"plumbing code\" like in this ProcessorContextImpl is akin to the JVM runtime after type erasure... the \"compiler\" has already done its job on the \"source code\" (the user-facing side of the PAPI), so we don't need the types anymore at \"run time\".", "author": "vvcephei", "createdAt": "2020-10-02T16:06:35Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5ODU2NDMyNw=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5ODkxNTYwMQ==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/9361#discussion_r498915601", "bodyText": "I think it would have been nice to get some kind of public-facing API into Topology like what I quoted above, but at this point, I think we can just cut scope on KIP-478 and implement it for 2.7 as-is.

Note that when a punctuator invokes {@link ProcessorContext#forward(Record)},\n     * downstream processors will receive the forwarded record as a regular\n     * {@link Processor#process(Record)} invocation. In other words, it wouldn't be apparent to\n     * downstream processors whether or not the record being processed came from an input topic\n     * or punctuation and therefore whether or not this metadata is defined. This is why\n     * the return type of this method is {@link Optional}.\n     * <p>\n     * If there is any possibility of punctuators upstream, any access\n     * to this field should consider the case of\n     * \"{@code recordMetadata().isPresent() == false}\".\n     * Of course, it would be safest to always guard this condition.\n     */", "author": "vvcephei", "createdAt": "2020-10-02T15:48:40Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5ODYxMDIxOQ=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5ODkwNTY2OA==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/9361#discussion_r498905668", "bodyText": "I've just updated the PR with this change.", "author": "vvcephei", "createdAt": "2020-10-02T15:50:44Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5ODYxMDIxOQ=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "a8de75f6f16cf8bdcccbcb1bc1fc0a11dd40c1d1", "url": "https://github.com/apache/kafka/commit/a8de75f6f16cf8bdcccbcb1bc1fc0a11dd40c1d1", "message": "docs", "committedDate": "2020-10-02T15:51:29Z", "type": "commit"}]}
