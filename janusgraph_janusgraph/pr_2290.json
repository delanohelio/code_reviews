After that your resume your debug and go fetching a new page (without actually processing any elements on this page). Basically, calling fetchResultSet() 2 times instead of 1 time.\nThat is why it contains fewer elements (i.e. 1 page fewer elements). Moreover, it's actually can produce more elements (in case you are debugging the last page in multi-page traversal).\nThat said, it's just some debugging problems and not related to the code directly.
